This year, my team and I participated in the Red Hat Summit keynote.
In front of 8000 people, we demonstrated real-time scheduling,
reacting on input that ultimately came from the audience's smartphones.
In the past 2 months, we created this application together with the other middleware teams
and under the excellent guidance of Burr Sutter.
It integrates various technologies
such as Android/Iphone accelerometers, OpenShift/Kubernetes, Quarkus,
KNative, TensorFlow, Kafka, Camel, Node.js, Infinispan, Drools and of course OptaPlanner.

We wrote a game. A game that simulates a typical manufacturing floor,
involving machines at assembly lines:

Those machines suffer attrition, which is detected by movements sensors.
With the help of the audience, we simulate those sensors by capturing accelerometer data from their phones.
_When things go shakey, things go breaky._
So as they shake their phone - or do more complex gestures - their machines receive damage.
Each part of the audience is connected to one machine,
and if the health of their machine drops to zero, it falls apart.

Now, those machines require maintenance before they break, which is where OptaPlanner comes in.
There are only 2 or 3 mechanics to fix them.
And while mechanics are traveling to a machine or fixing it, all machines continue to lose health.
Deciding the order in which to fix them, as damage comes in concurrently, is though.
Luckily, OptaPlanner can schedule those mechanics for us, in real-time.
